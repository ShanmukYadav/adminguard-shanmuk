## 1. Google AI Studio: Build Mode & Vibe Coding

### Concept
Vibe coding allows me to describe the application in plain English while the AI handles code generation.

### Build Mode
This is the primary interface for generating the application structure from a single descriptive prompt.

### Annotation Mode
I can use point-and-click editing to refine specific UI elements or logic without rewriting entire prompts.

### Iteration Strategy
The key is to refine and add features through conversation rather than attempting a "big bang" build.
